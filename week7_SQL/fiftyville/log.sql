--| Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking
           --by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

--| Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say
           -- that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the
           -- phone to purchase the flight ticket.
